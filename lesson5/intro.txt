We're told about npm, npmjs.com, how to install packages.

Nodemon:
First one to be installed is nodemon
Installing packages globally (npm install -g ***)
With nodemon running, no need to stop and restart server every time.

Package.json:
Keeps track of any packages we install locally & project details, scripts etc
If we use any 3 party elements in our project, we should definitely use package.json
We do that with 'npm init' in our project folder

Installing packages locally (to the project):
We're going to install a utility called lodash
npm i --save lodash (the --save arg puts it in project and saves reference to dependencies)

Dependencies:
If we have the dependencies listed in package.json, but we don't have the 'node_modules' folder containing them, we can just run 'npm install' in our main folder, and it will get the dependencies and install them
Quite often on github you won't find the node_modules folder, and will have to install dependencies after cloning the repository.
